## One Minute Madness - Changelog

### Version 0.4

[Download](./One%20Minute%20Madness%200.4.zip)

#### Zone connections

* Raised the value of certain zone connections.
    * Zones 1-7, 2-5 (between grass to enemy treasure): 12000
    * Zones 1-2 (between both treasures): 9000
    * Rationale: The connections between both halves of the map were undervalued - especially the shortcut connection between grass and the enemy treasure zone. This made red rush far too appealing, while also causing the games to end unsatisfactorily early. Additionally, the low difference between the connection values often made discerning between the connection types impossible. 
* Fixed the lack of Portal Repulsion between zones 2 and 5.

#### Zones 1 and 2

* Increased the treasure values to (3000-6000, 9), (10000-15000, 6), (15000-20000, 2). It is just an attempt to provide a tiny bit more consistency.
* Removed Cyclops Stockpiles. The resources granted by this creature bank aren't really a good reward on this template for the difficulty it poses, effectively making this bank worthless.

#### Zones 5 and 7

* Removed Naga Banks. Reasoning is exactly the same as for the Cyclops Stockpiles removal listed above.

#### Zones 6 and 8

* Removed Medusa Stores. Reasoning is again the same as above.
* Capped the amount of Windmills on this zone to 4. This is set to prevent RMG literally spamming windmills all across the zone on certain rolls, while also not removing them completely.

#### General settings

* Disabled Hill Forts. They had a very minor chance to spawn, and when they did they gave a major advantage to one of the players. They may be reintroduced later on in a more controlled manner.

#### Artifacts

* Banned the following artifacts:
    * Pendant of Dispassion, Pendant of Second Sight, Pendant of Holiness, Pendant of Life, Pendant of Death, Pendant of Free Will, Sphere of Permamence - most of these are far too situational to ever matter in the gameplay. Being protected from one rarely used spell in FB is far too underwhelming. Out of these artifacts, only the Pendant of Second Sight might be reasonably used - but in practice, Blind is not threatening enough to warrant the existence of this artifact.
    * Everflowing Crystal Cloak, Ring of Infinite Gems, Everpouring Vial of Mercury, Inexhaustible Cart of Ore, Eversmoking Ring of Sulfur, Inexhaustible Cart of Lumber - there is more than enough of resources that can be found on the ground. All these artifacts are serving just as a clutter.
    * Orb of the Firmament, Orb of Silt, Orb of Tempestuous Fire - the damage from spells isn't often the game-winning factor, and in the rare cases where it is, these orbs provide an unjust advantage that is hard to counter.
    * Bow of Elven Cherrywood, Bowstring of the Unicorn's Mane, Angel Feather Arrows - the archery bonus granted by these artifacts is ridicolously inconsequential. While they could be fine if they all were Treasure class artifacts, they are not - the Bowstring is Minor class, while the Arrows are Major class.

#### Minor Text Changes
* Updated the description to reflect the changes in road and timer recommendations.

### Version 0.3

[Download](./One%20Minute%20Madness%200.3.zip)

#### Zones 6 and 8

* Fixed the issue of Derricks not actually being disabled.
* Removed the Town Gate. While this object was placed to allow for higher mobility and far easier supply chains, it was not fulfilling this role properly.
* Changed the treasure values to (2500-3500, 9), (3000-5000, 16), (8000-12000, 4). After the removal of Town Gate, this zone was made barren and uninteresting. This is a temporary measure to offset this change.
* School of War and School of Magic both have their frequency increased to 200.

#### Zones 9 and 10

* Added the Town Gate to this zone.

#### Zones 1 and 2

* Mansions are completely removed - they were risky an unappealing choice, effectively making them more of a guarded obstacle instead of a point of interest they were meant to be.
* Added three 3 Churchyards with their object value increased to 2500. They are simple, consistent creature banks that are a good source of experience and artifacts - and as such they are an interesting addition to the desert. They perfectly fill the niche that Mansions were supposed to fill.
* Increased the frequency of both Minor and Major class artifacts to 400. They were simply not spawning enough.
* Added 2 Town Gates to this zone. They provide the much needed mobility to the starting town. They are also guarded, meaning you have to deliberately fight for access to this option.

### Version 0.2

[Download](./One%20Minute%20Madness%200.2.zip)

#### General

* Adjusted the values of Rock Block Radius and Zone Sparseness parameters.

#### Zones 6 and 8

* The value of Town Gate has been reduced to 4000 from the default value of 10000. The value of the Imp Cache was also reduced to 2500 from the default value of 5000. Both changes are introduced to increase the consistency of both objects spawning without massively increasing the amount of treasure, and as such the strength of guards on this zone.  
* Disabled the Trailblazer and Derrick in this zone. The Trailblazer wasn't a very interesting addition and made it harder for the RMG to fit all other objects that should spawn, while the Derricks were overwhelmingly common and were essentially littering this zone.  
* Removed the Trading Post rule, since it can't spawn on Wasteland anyway and as such it was redundant.  
* Increased the treasure values to (1500-3000, 9), (3000-5000, 12), (8000-12000, 3) from (1500-3000, 8), (3000-5000, 12), (8000-12000, 3).

#### Artifacts

* Banned the following artifacts: Vampire's Cowl, Dead Man's Boots, Amulet of the Undertaker, Ambassador's Sash, Diplomat's Ring, Statesman's Medal, Orb of Driving Rain, Bird of Perception, Stoic Watchman, Emblem of Cognizance, Legs of Legion, Loins of Legion, Torso of Legion, Arms of Legion and Head of Legion. The Necromancy boosting artifacts are banned because they favour Necropolis - which is regarded as one of the best factions in the game - while being nearly completely useless for all other factions. All other artifacts are banned because they are plain too weak and ineffective.

#### Spells

* Banned the following spells: Protection from Water, View Air, View Earth, Remove Obstacle, Earthquake, Land Mine, Fire Shield, Slayer and Magic Mirror. Most of these spells are far too niche and situational, and are effectively a waste of a precious spell slot in the Mage's Guild. The excaption are View Air and View Earth spells, which are banned because of two reasons - they are relatively slow to use, and they are giving a large amount of information for a low mana cost. There is also an exploit that allows to inspect the generated map even after the timer ends. This exploit is a non-issue on longer time controls, but on the one minute timer setting it is definitely unhealthy.

#### Heroes:

* Banned Ayden. This hero starts with View Earth spell, for which the ban rationale was listed above. Other heroes that start with the banned spells will aren't currently banned because their low impact on the game. If they will be deemed unviable, they will be banned.
