## One Minute Madness - Changelog

### Version 0.1

[Download](./mt_1MM%20v0.1.zip)

First version ever released!

The main differences from the One Minute Madness 1.3:
* Reworked connections between the treasure zones.
* Changed the town hints in the treasure zones - now, only one of the towns on this zone shares the faction with the players' faction, while the other one is forced to be different. This change is done for two reasons - the first reason is to prevent the excessive tier 1 and 2 powerstacks that would be possible otherwise, and the second is to add more variety to the gameplay and provide some differentation from the non-mirrorized counterpart.
* Banned the Estates secondary skill. It has a large impact even on the non-mirror version, giving a large amount of extra gold and effectively turning the hero into a walking goldmine. On mirror version, this can easily become a game winning advantage, and as such this skill is banned completely.
* Changed the hero banlist to the following:
    * Castle: Valeska, Lord Haart, Cuthbert
    * Rampart: Mephala, Giselle
    * Tower: Neela, Solmyr
    * Inferno: Calh, Ayden
    * Necropolis: Isra, Aislinn, Thant, Vidomina
    * Dungeon: Deemer
    * Stronghold: Crag Hack, Tyraxor, Gundula
    * Fortress: Tazar
    * Conflux: Thunar, Erdamon
    * Cove: Corkes, Jeremy, Leena

The list above is subject to change and requires testing. The rationale for the banlist above is as follows:

* Ulfretin, Piquedram and Straker are unbanned since they can't spawn as the army hero in tawern, and as such they become a non-issue.
* All heroes starting with the Estates skill are banned by proxy of the complete ban of the Estates skill.
* All heroes specializing in Armorer or Offence skills are banned due to their excessively high power.
* Jeremy is banned for providing the player with a free Cannon.
* Thant is banned for the virtue of giving a too large of advantage 
* Valeska, Calh and Tyraxor grant a large powerspike with their army, making them a way too obvious of a choice as the starting hero, that may not be reasonably offsetable with the starting gold.
* Isra and Vidomina, despite being reasonably equal with their specialties, are banned to make the hero choice in Necropolis a more complex and interesting decision.
